IoT-Based Hydroponic System

IoT-enabled hydroponic farming system aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture with minimal water usage. The system monitors and automates key environmental parameters suchntemperature, humidity, pH level, and nutrient concentration using sensors and microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino/Raspberry Pi). Real-time data is sent to a cloud platform for visualization and remote control, ensuring optimal growth conditions for plants.
